// Motivation

This is my very first project using web assembly. This is simple image manipulation tool that can be used in the browser. Instead of comparing it to Photoshop, consider it more of a simpler Lightroom.

All of the photo manipulation is done **without any external libraries** in rust and **ONLY with the html canvas element** provided by the browser.
