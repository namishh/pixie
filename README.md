// pixie: wasm image manipulator tool
</samp>

</div>

<samp>
// Motivation

This is my very first project using web assembly. This is simple image manipulation tool that can be used in the browser. Instead of comparing it to Photoshop, consider it more of a simpler Lightroom.
<br>

// Tech Stack
- Rust for all the image processing (no external libraries are used for doing that)
- Next.js for the front-end
- Shadcn for the UI components

// Features planned to support
- Loading and saving images (done)
- Resize, Rotate, and Scaling (done)
- Cropping Images
- Adding Texts and Shapes
- Controlling hue, saturation, contrast and brightness
- Add borders to images
- Filters like blur, sharpen, pixelate
- Grayscale, Sepia, Invert, etc
