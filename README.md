// Motivation

This is my very first project using web assembly. This is simple image manipulation tool that can be used in the browser. Instead of comparing it to Photoshop, consider it more of a simpler Lightroom.

All of the photo manipulation is done **without any external libraries** in rust and **ONLY with the html canvas element** provided by the browser.

// Tech Stack
- Rust for all the image processing
- Next.js for the front-end
- Shadcn for the UI components

// Features planned to support

- Resize, Rotate, and Scaling (done)
- Cropping Images
- Adding Texts and Shapes
- Controlling hue, saturation, contrast and brightness
- Add borders to images
- Filters like blur, sharpen, pixelate
- Grayscale, Sepia, Invert, etc
